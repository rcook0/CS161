# Chapter 08 — Greedy Algorithms

## Theorem 8.1 (Interval Scheduling Optimality) [P3]
Greedy earliest-finish-time schedule is optimal via exchange argument.

## Lemma 8.2 (Huffman Merge Lemma) [P3, P2]
Two least frequent symbols can be merged without increasing optimal cost.

## Theorem 8.3 (Huffman Correctness) [P3]
Repeated merging yields optimal prefix code.
