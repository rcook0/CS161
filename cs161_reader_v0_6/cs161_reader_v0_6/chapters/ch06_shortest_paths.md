# Chapter 06 — Shortest Paths

## Invariant 6.1 (Upper Bound) [P5]
Distance estimates always upper-bound true shortest paths.

## Theorem 6.3 (Dijkstra Finalization) [P5, P2]
When a vertex is finalized, its distance is optimal.

## Theorem 6.6 (Bellman–Ford Correctness) [P5, P1]
After n-1 passes without negative cycles, all distances are optimal.
