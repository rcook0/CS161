# Proof Pattern Registry (Canonical)

Pattern IDs are stable across releases.

- **P1 — Induction**: size/structure induction; recurrences; DP correctness.
- **P2 — Invariant**: loop/DFS/BFS invariants; termination/monovariant.
- **P3 — Exchange Argument**: transform optimal solution to match greedy choice.
- **P4 — Cut Property**: safe edges across cuts (MST).
- **P5 — Relaxation**: upper bounds converge to optimum (SSSP, DP-as-DAG).
- **P6 — Expectation (Indicators)**: event indicators + linearity of expectation.
- **P7 — Amplification**: repetition reduces Monte Carlo failure probability.
- **P8 — DP Optimal Substructure**: state/recurrence/base/order/correctness/reconstruct.
- **P9 — Amortized**: aggregate/accounting/potential; telescoping charges.
- **P10 — Reduction**: poly-time mapping with iff correctness.
- **P11 — Adversary / Decision Tree**: lower bounds via information/adversary.
