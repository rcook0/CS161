# Chapter 08 — Greedy Algorithms

## Theorem 8.1 (Interval Scheduling Optimality) [P3] {#thm-8-1}
Earliest-finish-time schedule is optimal by exchange.

## Lemma 8.2 (Huffman Merge Lemma) [P3,P2] {#lem-8-2}
Two least frequent symbols can be siblings in an optimal code.

## Theorem 8.3 (Huffman Correctness) [P3] {#thm-8-3}
Repeated merging yields an optimal prefix code.
