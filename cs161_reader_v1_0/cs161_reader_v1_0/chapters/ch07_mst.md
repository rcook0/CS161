# Chapter 07 — Minimum Spanning Trees

## Definition (Cut Property) [P4] {#def-cut-property}
Lightest edge across any cut is safe.

## Theorem 7.1 (Prim Correctness) [P4,P2] {#thm-7-1}
Choosing min crossing edge preserves existence of an MST containing chosen edges.

## Theorem 7.2 (Kruskal Correctness) [P4] {#thm-7-2}
Adding edges by increasing weight and skipping cycles yields an MST.
