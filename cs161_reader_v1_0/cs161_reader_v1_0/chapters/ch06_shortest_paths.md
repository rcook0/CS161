# Chapter 06 — Shortest Paths

## Invariant 6.1 (Upper Bound) [P5] {#inv-6-1}
Estimates satisfy $d[v]\ge\delta(s,v)$.

## Theorem 6.3 (Dijkstra Finalization) [P5,P2] {#thm-6-3}
With nonnegative weights, finalized distances are optimal.

## Theorem 6.6 (Bellman–Ford Correctness) [P5,P1] {#thm-6-6}
Without reachable negative cycles, $n-1$ passes suffice.
